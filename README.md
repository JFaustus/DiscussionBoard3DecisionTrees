# DiscussionBoard3DecisionTrees
This is a project for my discussion board. I used the wine data set from scikit learn with a decision tree model to solve a classification problem. This was made in jupyter notebook with comments on the processes of each part and what they are supposed to do within the code. The wine data set is a problem set where you learn to use a machine learning algorithm to classify the different wines as three different categories of wine. Taking these you can make a model that will try and categorize it based on these three as the y adn then easily test how accurate each model you used is with the data and how they all differ from one another on accuracy.
